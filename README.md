# What is shiritori?

Shiritori is a Japanese word game. Literally translated, it means "End taking."

It's played by multiple players. One player says one Japanese word which starts with the ending of the word "shi-ri-to-ri"(that is, "ri"). So s/he says a word such as "ri-n-go (apple).").

The next player says a word which starts with the ending of the previous word.("ri-n-go" â†’ "go-ri-ra (gorilla)") The players keep doing and if one says a word which has been said or ends with "n" (no Japanese word starts with "n"), the player loses the game.

# Why am I making this?

Little children in Japan often play the game and it helps them increase vocabulary. My thought is the game could be used to Japanese as Second Language Teaching. So I'm making this program.

I cannot make anything complicated now since I have just started programming. But I'm planning to add more features in the future. I really appreciate your feedback if you have any opinion about this project.

# Features I'd like to add in the future

-difficulty adjustment (the users can change the number of mistakes they can make in the game.)

-graphic user interface

-voice recognition

-automatic play with CPU (CPU chooses a word from database which contains basic Japanese words. Corpus linguistics may be helpful to determine which words should be included.)

-(if possible)linking the databe with Japanese textbooks (For example, lets' say the user uses "Genki(one of the popular Japanese textbook)" for learning Japanese and has finished "Genki 1". CPU chooses a word from what the user has learned in the textbook. ) This one might be difficult because I have to get permission from the publisher first.

-User defined dictionary (Other than the words in the database noted above, users can add words to the dictionary.)

-linking the game with the Internet. (When a player enters a word this software Googles the word and shows 3~5 images. one of them is the image of the word the player has entered and the others are irrelavant ones. The player has to choose the correct image.)

-dictation mode (CPU says a word and the user has to type it correctly in order to proceed to their turn.)

-attack (CPU sometimes make mistakes and the user has to point out the mistake.)

-timer (the user has to type a word within 30 seconds.)
