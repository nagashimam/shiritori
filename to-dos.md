- [] difficulty adjustment (the users can change the number of mistakes they can make in the game.)

- [] graphic user interface

- [] voice recognition

- [] automatic play with CPU (CPU chooses a word from database which contains basic Japanese words. Corpus linguistics may be helpful to determine which words should be included.)

- [] (if possible)linking the databe with Japanese textbooks (For example, lets' say the user uses "Genki(one of the popular Japanese textbook)" for learning Japanese and has finished "Genki 1". CPU chooses a word from what the user has learned in the textbook. ) This one might be difficult because I have to get permission from the publisher first.

- [] User defined dictionary (Other than the words in the database noted above, users can add words to the dictionary.)

- [] linking the game with the Internet. (When a player enters a word this software Googles the word and shows 3~5 images. one of them is the image of the word the player has entered and the others are irrelavant ones. The player has to choose the correct image.)

- [] dictation mode (CPU says a word and the user has to type it correctly in order to proceed to their turn.)

- [] attack (CPU sometimes make mistakes and the user has to point out the mistake.)

- [] timer (the user has to type a word within 30 seconds.)
