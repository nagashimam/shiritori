#What is being worked on
- [ ] There seem to be some bug(s) in the ending condition. Find out and fix the bug(s).
- [ ] A condition in replacePrevEnd() of Player class is wrong. The new prevEnd should be the vowel of the second last sound in case the word ends with long vowel.   

#Version 2 or later.
- [ ] difficulty adjustment (the users can change the number of mistakes they can make in the game.)

- [ ] The players can enter their name and use them during the game.

- [ ] timer (the user has to type a word within 30 seconds.)

- [ ] graphic user interface

- [ ] voice recognition

- [ ] dictation mode (CPU says a word and the user has to type it correctly in order to proceed to their turn.)

- [ ] repeat mode (Player has to repeat what CPU says)

- [ ] automatic play with CPU (CPU chooses a word from database which contains basic Japanese words. Corpus linguistics may be helpful to determine which words should be included.)

- [ ] User defined dictionary (Other than the words in the database noted above, users can add words to the dictionary.)

- [ ] automatic database update (words which are popular among the user-difined dictionaries are automatically added to the database.)


- [ ] (if possible)linking the databe with Japanese textbooks (For example, lets' say the user uses "Genki(one of the popular Japanese textbook)" for learning Japanese and has finished "Genki 1". CPU chooses a word from what the user has learned in the textbook. ) This one might be difficult because I have to get permission from the publisher first.

- [ ] linking the game with the Internet. (When a player enters a word this software Googles the word and shows 3~5 images. one of them is the image of the word the player has entered and the others are irrelavant ones. The player has to choose the correct image.)

- [ ] attack (CPU sometimes make mistakes and the user has to point out the mistake.)
